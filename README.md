**gentry** is a Python package for representing and manipulating generic tree structures with support for extensible child groups, visitor patterns, and convenient representations (including Markdown and Mermaid diagrams).

The name **gentry** is a weak pun on 'generic tree' that is too lame to explain 😄 (See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry))

## AI slop

this readme and the API docs were created with copilot for now. And quite frankly, it's nearly unreadable. bear with me, i will rewrite it in the near future.

## Features

- **Generic Tree Structure**:  
  The core [`gentry.tree.Tree`](gentry/tree.py) class allows you to define trees with arbitrary child groups, supporting both simple and complex hierarchical data.

- **Customizable Child Groups**:  
  Subclasses can define their own sets of child groups (e.g., `left`, `right`, `children`), enabling flexible tree shapes and semantics.

- **Visitor Pattern**:  
  The [`gentry.tree.Visitor`](gentry/tree.py) class provides a robust visitor pattern implementation, making it easy to traverse and process trees in a structured way.

- **Counting and Analysis**:  
  The [`gentry.tree.Count`](gentry/tree.py) visitor counts nodes in a tree, handling nested and grouped children.

- **Rich Representations**:  
  Trees can be represented as strings, and the package supports exporting to Markdown and Mermaid formats for visualization (see [`gentry.mermaid`](gentry/mermaid.py)).

- **Extensive Testing**:  
  The package includes a comprehensive test suite ([tests/](tests/)) covering initialization, group handling, subclassing, and visitor behaviors.

## Example Usage

```python
from gentry.tree import Tree

class BinaryTree(Tree):
    _groups = {"left", "right"}

root = BinaryTree(label="root")
left = BinaryTree(label="left")
right = BinaryTree(label="right")
root.left.append(left)
root.right.append(right)

print(root)
```

### Using Visitors

```python
from gentry.tree import Visitor

class PrintLabelsVisitor(Visitor):
    def _do_printlabelsvisitor(self, tree):
        print(tree.label)

visitor = PrintLabelsVisitor(root)
visitor.visit()
```

### Counting Nodes

```python
from gentry.tree import Count

counter = Count(root)
print(counter.count())  # Outputs the number of nodes in the tree
```

## Installation

```sh
pip install gentry
```
